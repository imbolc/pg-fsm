FSM-based Resumable Postgres tasks

- **FSM-based** - each task is a granular state machine
- **Resumable** - on error, after you fix the step logic or the external
  world, the task is able to pick up where it stopped
- **Postgres** - a single table is enough to handle task scheduling, state
  transitions, and error processing

## Tutorial

_The full runnable code is in [examples/tutorial.rs][tutorial-example]._

### Defining Tasks

We create a greeter task consisting of two steps:

```rust,ignore
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct ReadName {
    filename: String,
}

#[async_trait]
impl Step<Greeter> for ReadName {
    const RETRY_LIMIT: i32 = 5;

    async fn step(self, _db: &PgPool) -> StepResult<Greeter> {
        let name = std::fs::read_to_string(&self.filename)?;
        NextStep::now(SayHello { name })
    }
}
```

The first step tries to read a name from a file:

- `filename` - the only state we need in this step
- `impl Step<Greeter> for ReadName` - our step is a part of a `Greeter` task
- `RETRY_LIMIT` - the step is fallible, let's retry it a few times
- `NextStep::now(SayHello { name })` - move our task to the `SayHello` step
  right now

```rust,ignore
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct SayHello {
    name: String,
}
#[async_trait]
impl Step<Greeter> for SayHello {
    async fn step(self, _db: &PgPool) -> StepResult<Greeter> {
        println!("Hello, {}", self.name);
        NextStep::none()
    }
}
```

The second step prints the greeting and finishes the task returning
`NextStep::none()`.

That's essentially all, except for some boilerplate you can find in the
[full code][tutorial-example]. Let's run it:

```bash
cargo run --example hello
```

### Investigating Errors

You'll see log messages about the 6 (first try + `RETRY_LIMIT`) attempts and
the final error message. Let's look into the DB to find out what happened:

```bash
~$ psql pg_task -c 'table pg_task'
-[ RECORD 1 ]------------------------------------------------
id         | cddf7de1-1194-4bee-90c6-af73d9206ce2
step       | {"Greeter":{"ReadName":{"filename":"name.txt"}}}
wakeup_at  | 2024-06-30 09:32:27.703599+06
tried      | 6
is_running | f
error      | No such file or directory (os error 2)
created_at | 2024-06-30 09:32:22.628563+06
updated_at | 2024-06-30 09:32:27.703599+06
```

- a non-null `error` field indicates that the task has errored and contains
  the error message
- the `step` field provides you with the information about a particular step
  and its state when the error occurred

### Fixing the World

In this case, the error is due to the external world state. Let's fix it by
creating the file:

```bash
echo 'Fixed World' > name.txt
```

To rerun the task, we just need to clear its `error`:

```bash
psql pg_task -c 'update pg_task set error = null'
```

You'll see the log messages about rerunning the task and the greeting
message of the final step. That's all ðŸŽ‰.

## Scheduling Tasks

Essentially scheduling a task is done by inserting a corresponding row into
the `pg_task` table. You can do in by hands from `psql` or code in any
language.

There's also a few helpers to take care of the first step serialization and
time scheduling:
- [`enqueue`] - to run the task immediately
- [`delay`] - to run it with a delay
- [`schedule`] - to schedule it to a particular time

## Running Workers

After [defining](#defining-tasks) the steps of each task, we need to
wrap them into enums representing whole tasks via [`task!`]:

```rust,ignore
pg_task::task!(Task1 { StepA, StepB });
pg_task::task!(Task2 { StepC });
```

One more enum is needed to combine all the possible tasks:

```rust,ignore
pg_task::scheduler!(Tasks { Task1, Task2 });
```

Now we can run the worker:

```rust,ignore
pg_task::Worker::<Tasks>::new(db).run().await?;
```

All the communication is synchronized by the DB, so it doesn't matter how or
how many workers you run. It could be a separate process as well as
in-process [`tokio::spawn`].

## Stopping Workers

You can gracefully stop task runners by sending a notification using the
DB:

```sql
SELECT pg_notify('pg_task_changed', 'stop_worker');
```

The workers would wait until the current step of all the tasks is finished
and then exit. You can wait for this by checking for the existence of
running tasks:

```sql
SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM pg_task WHERE is_running = true);
```

## Delaying Steps

Sometimes you need to delay the next step. Using [`tokio::time::sleep`]
before returning the next step creates a couple of issues:

- if the process is crashed while sleeping it wont be considered done and
  will rerun on restart
- you'd have to wait for the sleeping task to finish on [gracefulshutdown](#stopping-workers)

Use [`NextStep::delay`] instead - it schedules the next step with the delay
and finishes the current one right away.

You can find a runnable example in the [examples/delay.rs][delay-example]

## Retrying Steps

Use [`Step::RETRY_LIMIT`] and [`Step::RETRY_DELAY`] when you need to retry a
task on errors:

```rust,ignore
impl Step<MyTask> for ApiRequest {
    const RETRY_LIMIT: i32 = 5;
    const RETRY_DELAY: Duration = Duration::from_secs(5);

    async fn step(self, _db: &PgPool) -> StepResult<MyTask> {
        let result = api_request().await?;
        NextStep::now(ProcessResult { result })
    }
}
```
